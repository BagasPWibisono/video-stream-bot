# Stream bot video
Fork: [Discord-video-experiment](https://github.com/mrjvs/Discord-video-experiment)

This project implements the custom Discord UDP protocol for sending media. Since Discord is likely change their custom protocol, this library is subject to break at any point. An effort will be made to keep this library up to date with the latest Discord protocol, but it is not guranteed.

For better stability it is recommended to use WebRTC protocol instead since Discord is forced to adhere to spec, which means that the non-signaling code is guaranteed to work.
